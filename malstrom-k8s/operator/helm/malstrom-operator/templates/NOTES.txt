Successfully deployed the Malstrom operator to namspace {{ .Values.namespace }}.
If you deployed the artifact manager it can be accessed via:
`artifact-manager.{{ .Values.namespace }}.svc.cluster.local`.
You can use the http endpoint as the binary URI in the job definition.

*NOTE*: You first need to upload a binary to the artifact manager by forwarding the 
`artifact-manager` service to your local host and then running
`curl -F "file=@<absolute path to binary>" localhost:<port>/<binary-name>`

Good luck!
